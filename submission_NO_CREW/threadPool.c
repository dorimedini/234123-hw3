 *    give up the lock until there is a task to run OR the tpDestroy
 *    function sent a broadcast to all threads that they should clean
 *    up
 * 2. Wait for the signal (task inserted, or tp being destroyed)
 * 3. Now that the queue is locked, check the destruction state
 * 4. If we're ALIVE, that means pool->queue IS NOT EMPTY (otherwise we
 *    would still be in the while loop), so we can just dequeue a task
 *    and run it (remember to unlock before running!)
 * 5. If we're DO_ALL, it's like ALIVE but first check if there's
 *    something to run (unlike the ALIVE state, we don't know for sure).
 *    If there is, run it; otherwise, terminate (no more tasks will come)
 * 6. If we're DO_RUN, terminate. Don't take another task, leave them to rot
