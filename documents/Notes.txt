1.  Maybe we should use several different locks for the process queue?
    One for destruction, one for creation... etc. For example, when creating
	a new process, first try locking the destruction lock and if we fail
	then that means that we can't add any more processes because we're
	destroying the queue so there's no point in taking the creation queue:
	- void createth(queue) {
	-     if (lock(queue->dest)) return;
	-     while(lock(queue->create));	// <--- Is this safe?
	-     ... create task ...
	-     unlock(queue->create);
	-     unlock(queue->dest);

2.  The PDF says we can't lock long code so maybe we can't lock thread queue
    destruction?
