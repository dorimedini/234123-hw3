	/**
	 * QUESTION:
	 *
	 * How should we implement R/W protection of the "state" field?
	 * This is a readers-writers problem. We shouldn't allow multiple
	 * writers ("destroy" can only be done once), we should allow lots
	 * of readers (all threads read this all the time) and we should
	 * let the writer get high priority.
	 *
	 * Remember - we NEED to allow infinite simultaneous readers of the
	 * pool state, because of this possible scenario:
	 * - add() is called, we call start_read()
	 * - CONTEXT SWITCH
	 * - A thread start it's while() loop and does acquire_lock(pool->task_lock) 
	 * - Enters the inner while() loop, calls read_state()
	 * If we use mutex locks, read_state() needs to wait for add(), and add()
	 * needs to wait for the thread!
	 *
	 * Useful links:
	 * - http://lass.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/courses/fall08/lectures/Lec11.pdf (PAGES 4-5)

 *    give up the lock until there is a task to run OR the tp_destroy
 *    function sent a broadcast to all threads that they should clean
 *    up.
 * 2. Wait for the signal (task inserted, or tp being destroyed).
 * 3. Now that the queue is locked, check the destruction state. This
 *    state should be valid because a. the change from ALIVE to
 *    something else is a one-way change, b. even if the following
 *    happened:
 *    - Task added
 *    - Thread got out of the WHILE loop
 *    - CONTEXT SWITCH
 *    - Main thread (pool creator) called tp_destroy, state changed
 *    - CONTEXT SWITCH
 *    - Back to our thread, got to the switch() statement and found
 *      out we're dying
 *    ... Is this OK? I asked Piazza (@281)... I hope so, because I
 *    can't think of a way to serialize task addition and destruction
 *    in a simple way...
 *    ... If this isn't allowed, how do we tell the difference between
 *    a task that we SHOULD complete even though we're in DO_RUN mode,
 *    and which task should we leave in the queue to rot?
 * 4. If we're ALIVE, that means pool->queue IS NOT EMPTY (otherwise we
 *    would still be in the while loop, because you can't change DO_RUN
 *    or DO_ALL back to ALIVE so there's no danger we left the while()
 *    loop because of state!=ALIVE but got to state==ALIVE in the
 *    switch), so we can just dequeue a task and run it (remember to
 *    unlock before running!).
 * 5. If we're DO_ALL, it's like ALIVE but first check if there's
 *    something to run (unlike the ALIVE state, we don't know for sure).
 *    If there is, run it; otherwise, exit (no more tasks will come).
 * 6. If we're DO_RUN, exit. Don't take another task, leave them to rot.
